1: For each RandomMonster that will move, also move pacman.
Everytime all Monsters move, pacman will move twice.
The function changes because "}" , which indicates the end of statement, is moved at end of "macman.makemove", making method "for randomMonster" include both "macman.makemove" and "rm.makeMove()".
Each time "for randomMonster" runs,both "macman.makemove" and "rm.makeMove()" will be excuted.

2:pacman = new Pacman(this); (construct from class:Pacman)
  		randomMonsters = new LinkedList<RandomMonster>(); (construct from class: LinkedList<RandomMonster>)

3:sprite.setLocation(new_x, new_y); is being called
two parameters are called. they are: int new_x, int new_y

4: 1st iteration: x=0; y=0;
2nd iteration: x=1; y=0;
16th iteration: x=2; y=1;
(x+1) indicates which column "TrackerMonster s" added into "trackerMonsters"
(y+1) indicates which row "TrackerMonster s" added into "trackerMonsters"

5: if I set the breakpoint at the end of "private void initBoard()", sizes of Monsters will be shown: TrackerMonsters size=1, randomMonsters size=2.

6: || means logical OR. a||b means a^b
